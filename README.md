# Cricket-Dataset
Successfully web scraped close to 70 attributes of 5000+ cricketers to create a dataset from scratch

Scraped 3 game formats[ODI,TEST,T20] with each format having it's own python code, csv file and excel file. 
To understand the process swiftly I'd encourage reading the Document.pdf documentation and go through any of the game formats python scraping code using BeautifulSoup.
